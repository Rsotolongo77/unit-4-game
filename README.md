## Gem Collector is a web application that challenges the user to match the random unmber generated by the program.

## Technologies used:

## How the app works:
The user is presented with a random number to match. Four crystals with randomly generated hidden values for each are presented. The user then tries to match the number using the crystals values without going over the number to match. If the user matches the number they are given a "win", otherwise they are given a "loss".
